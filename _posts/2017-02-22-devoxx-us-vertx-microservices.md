Vert.x is the reactive programming toolkit for the JVM. It provides a full stack environment for building microservices environments, using different JVM languages like Java, Groovy, Ruby and JavaScript.

Due to its event driven nature, it enforces developers to think in components. It scales beautifully, both horizontal and vertical. Vert.x is continually improving and the team is constantly adding new features. In this session we will look at the new features in Vert.x 3.3, which adds support for Service discovery, integration with Kubernetes, HTTP2 support and an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern. We also look at the future of Vert.x of version 3.4 and beyond.
